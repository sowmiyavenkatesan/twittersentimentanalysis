I implore you not to click on @Rosie's tweet here and to then retweet it to @realDonaldTrump in any way. He'd probably hate this article, and we don't want to wreck his next golf game by making it go viral or anything. https://t.co/6A9LJemB1v
This afternoon at the @WhiteHouse, it was my great honor to present our nation’s highest civilian honor, the Presidential Medal of Freedom, to American baseball legend @MarianoRivera. Congratulations on this extraordinary achievement, Mo! https://t.co/nzOeqFNb3C
@realDonaldTrump @WhiteHouse @MarianoRivera @restartleader educated Iranians politically and formed the largest movement against the corrupt Islamic regime in Iran, while Msm and social media were censoring him heavily.Now #Restart members are everywhere. https://t.co/uyCxcuqAmF

@realDonaldTrump @WhiteHouse @MarianoRivera Thanks, Mr. President, for honoring this American Gentleman and Hero. 🇺🇸
@realDonaldTrump @WhiteHouse @MarianoRivera Must be nice. See what happens in the great state of Nevada if you're a injured firefighter with COPD and end up in the VA hospital for 9 months and too sick or ill to register your car or pay insurance, they will treat you like a criminal. Sad but true.
@realDonaldTrump @WhiteHouse @MarianoRivera Was Mike Pounds there?

@realDonaldTrump @POTUS @WhiteHouse @MarianoRivera Thanks for giving this man the Medal of Freedom, @POTUS . It is very much appreciated.

@realDonaldTrump @WhiteHouse @MarianoRivera OK.  That's actually cool with me.
@realDonaldTrump @WhiteHouse @MarianoRivera Amazing man Mariano.
@realDonaldTrump @WhiteHouse @MarianoRivera Do some work, Whiskey Delta.  Try reading Mattis’ book...you might pick up some leadership pointers.
@realDonaldTrump @WhiteHouse @MarianoRivera I have just unfollowed @MarianoRivera... what a shame
@realDonaldTrump @WhiteHouse @MarianoRivera I bet you asked his immigration status before you agreed to give him the medal. 🙄
@realDonaldTrump @WhiteHouse @MarianoRivera Donal loves watching contact sports, wars and CNN. But won’t do sports or wars personally and swears he doesn’t watch CNN
@realDonaldTrump @WhiteHouse @MarianoRivera A reporter asked Trump if he stands with the auto workers and Trump responds by talking about the votes he got from auto workers.What does that have to do with this situation?
@realDonaldTrump @WhiteHouse @MarianoRivera Just curious. How much does it cost to buy one of those medals from Trump? Does he have to claim the income?
@realDonaldTrump @WhiteHouse @MarianoRivera "Thank you, Cabinet."What...no love for the fridge, the dishwasher, the stove, or the oven?!
@realDonaldTrump @WhiteHouse @MarianoRivera all this is is campaigning for the minority vote!!!
@realDonaldTrump @WhiteHouse @MarianoRivera Congratulations  !
@realDonaldTrump @WhiteHouse @MarianoRivera Should have gone to Chef Jose Andrés. He's a true hero.
@realDonaldTrump @WhiteHouse @MarianoRivera Today at the White House it was my great honor to further make the Presidential Medal of Freedom mean nothing.
@realDonaldTrump @WhiteHouse @MarianoRivera Can you pump the markets good enough tomorrow? FED might not cut .50 on Wednesday, so it’ll be compensated.
@realDonaldTrump @WhiteHouse @MarianoRivera Mo is right. 🙄
@realDonaldTrump @POTUS @WhiteHouse @MarianoRivera Thank you President Trump for all you do!!!!

@realDonaldTrump @jblandonc @WhiteHouse @MarianoRivera Bravo Mariano 🇵🇦👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻
@realDonaldTrump @POTUS @WhiteHouse @MarianoRivera A great pity that the incumbent has cheapened this award.
@realDonaldTrump @WhiteHouse @MarianoRivera اوقاتكم سعيدة سيد الرئيس .نرجو منكم الوفاء بوعودكم الأنتخابية التي قطعتموها بشأن بلدي كما نرجو بوفاء وعودكم بعد انتخابكم مرة أخرة عندما تفوزون ونرجو بضبط النفس مع إيران ونطالب بالأشتماع مع السيد الرئيس روحاني حتى يتم تخفيف التوتر .
@realDonaldTrump @WhiteHouse @MarianoRivera Every time the president posts to twitter, there is always an immediate diatribe about how horrible he is. Not one piece of recognition about anything good he has done. Its unrealistically unbalanced, there is an avalanche of support for him across much of America.
@realDonaldTrump @WhiteHouse @MarianoRivera I can’t thank you enough Mr. President everything you do for this country! I feel so safe and I have prospered in so many ways with you being president! I just hope in the future it always feels like it does right now! May God bless you and your family!

@realDonaldTrump @WhiteHouse @MarianoRivera I want one...lol...how great!  You choose well. I've done as much or more for children's reading.....lol
@realDonaldTrump @WhiteHouse @MarianoRivera Is it just me, or has @realDonaldTrump made it so the #MedalOfFreedom is no longer a coveted prize?It seems to go to...anybody...these days.
@realDonaldTrump @WhiteHouse @MarianoRivera He's the greatest pitcher or the greatest reliever, which we want but we want greatest pitcher, too. Greatest reliever is great but greatest pitcher, would be great, and greatest reliever, that's great too, but greatest pitcher is great too. https://t.co/2rIbcRJJTK
@realDonaldTrump @thebling_vote @WhiteHouse @MarianoRivera Publisher Julian Assange deserves a medal. World needs @wikileaks #FreeAssange https://t.co/TzPm9ZUayE
@realDonaldTrump @WhiteHouse @MarianoRivera Trump has devalued this great honor tremendously by giving it to his favorite sports stars. What a pity.
@realDonaldTrump @WhiteHouse @MarianoRivera https://t.co/l3Ak96gvgc
@realDonaldTrump @WhiteHouse @MarianoRivera IQ 45 has drug  our nation’s highest civilian honor through the mud by previously awarding it to Miriam Adelson. https://t.co/ylUFG8XCwz

@realDonaldTrump @RealMattCouch @WhiteHouse @MarianoRivera 😳👇🏽 https://t.co/X32NFgDeuz
@realDonaldTrump @WhiteHouse @MarianoRivera When you gave it to one of your donors, you cheapened it to the level of a participation trophy.
@realDonaldTrump @WhiteHouse @MarianoRivera Time to hand out medals to some Spanish folks since Trump's approval rating with Hispanics is so low. Next it will be farmers and truckers, they're not happy campers with Trump either.
@realDonaldTrump @WhiteHouse @MarianoRivera YES HE IS AND U R NOT #IMPEACHMENT #PRISON #KARMA
@realDonaldTrump @WhiteHouse @MarianoRivera the right thing to do POTUS!
@realDonaldTrump @WhiteHouse @MarianoRivera Man @twitter is shadow banning Trump's tweets HARD! his popularity keeps going up yet his retweets and favorites keep going down...Bias @jack
@realDonaldTrump @WhiteHouse @MarianoRivera Everyone WATCH A REPLAY of FULL Ceremony for MO! It was the BOMB!! Whoops~ poorchoice if words...but WATCH IT! ⚾️🏅⚾️🏅🇺🇸🍺
@realDonaldTrump Great to see that you recognized Panamanian immigrant Mariano Rivera with the Presidential Medal of Freedom.Now start treating other immigrants who make America great with similar respect.
@realDonaldTrump @WhiteHouse @MarianoRivera The #FakePOTUS awards the accomplished immigrant:"Rivera played baseball with friends on the beach at low tide. They used milk cartons for gloves, tree branches for bats, shredded fishing nets for balls. 18, he joined the amateur team Panamá Oeste Vaqueros as a utility player." https://t.co/JkvMTnib9V
@realDonaldTrump @WhiteHouse @MarianoRivera This is great. Mariano was the greatest. He and Jeter were two best you could ever dream of on the same team. Congratulations Mariano
@realDonaldTrump @WhiteHouse @MarianoRivera I used to live in NYC in the 90s and early 2000s.  @MarianoRivera used to be my all-time favorite baseball player. Now he has chosen to be Donald's political pawn. Doesnt change his Yankee legacy.  But I will say I'm disappointed to say the least.
@realDonaldTrump @WhiteHouse @MarianoRivera Apologies to Mariano. Should've been presented by a real POTUS.
@realDonaldTrump @WhiteHouse @MarianoRivera Poor Mariano. Any medal or award conferred by you is tainted.
